      <p class="about-paragraph1">Currently, I am employed as a clinical coordinator at a busy specialist physician office. This opportunity allows me to navigate important health information management techniques, manage and supervise staff, and interact with the public.  In December 2014 I completed my Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in English from Oakland University. This education has allowed me to possess excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s Degree in Library and Information Management from Wayne State University. My current educational pursuits has opened many doors for my quest to integrate information seeking with technological advancements. I truly enjoy tackling technological challenges, as well as information analytics. </p>
